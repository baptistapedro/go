### How to run fuzzers

*Build and run a single fuzzer with Docker*
- Current Dockerfile builds the harness in ./types/ though just change the filename to build a different one.


*Build all fuzzers by running `build_all_fuzers.sh`*
- Fuzzers binaries will be generated in ./bin_fuzz
> ./bin_fuzz/fuzz_strkey_decode
